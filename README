Ouray was a project I started awhile back to help myself and my maths friends collaborate on maths.  I was trying to do an MVP and have it evolve from there.  Sadly, no one really used it.  So it's stayed an MVP. I decided in Feb put the sourcecode to some of my personal projects on github, and I've not done much to the code to make it friendlier to other programmers or environments.  I hope, at least, that my uncommented undocumented code isn't too obsfucated for other programmers to understand.  Just follow the code in each /controller file.  You can see a working example at sneffel.com, of course.  And feel free to email me any questions.

PS there's a lot of code here from other open source projects (e.g jquery).  I apologize for the duplicates!
